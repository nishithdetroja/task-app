Angular Developer Skill Test Case: Task Management Application

Objective: Develop a Task Management Application using Angular to demonstrate proficiency in building scalable and maintainable applications.

Project Overview:

Create an application that allows users to manage tasks. Each task should have a title, description, priority level, status (e.g., open, in progress, completed), and a due date. The application should have the following features:

1. Task Display and Management:
   - Display tasks in a list with options to view/edit/delete each task.
   - Implement filtering and sorting of tasks based on priority and due date.
   - Users should be able to mark tasks as completed or change their status.

2. Task Creation:
   - Create a form to add new tasks to the list with validation for each field.

3. Advanced Features:
   - Implement a drag-and-drop interface for changing the order of tasks or moving them between different status columns (e.g., a Kanban board style).
   - Use a modal or a separate route to view detailed task information and edit it.

4. State Management:
   - Use services or a state management library (e.g., NgRx, NGXS, or Akita) to handle the state of tasks.

5. Persistent Storage:
   - Tasks should persist between sessions (consider using localStorage, a simple JSON server, or Firebase for a real backend experience).

6. Routing:
   - Implement routing in the application to navigate between different views (e.g., Task List, Add Task, Task Details).

7. Testing:
   - Write unit tests for components and services.
   - Optionally, write end-to-end tests demonstrating key user flows.

Guidelines for Implementation:

- The application should be created using the latest version of Angular.
- Employ Angular best practices for structuring and coding the application.
- Ensure the application is responsive and has a user-friendly interface.
- Include a README file with instructions on how to set up and run the application.

Evaluation Criteria:

- Code organization, quality, and clarity.
- Implementation of the features as described.
- Effective use of Angular's core concepts (components, services, routing, etc.).
- Application performance and error handling.
- Comprehensive testing strategy and coverage.

Delivery:

- Provide the complete source code hosted on a platform like GitHub or GitLab.
- Include a live version of the application, if possible, hosted on platforms like Netlify, Vercel, or Firebase.
- Ensure the application can be easily set up and run locally following the instructions in the README.
